:Description: My Dockerfiles
:Licence: GPL
:Registry: https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/mkoskar/

These Dockerfiles are to be built into Docker images and published
to `Docker Hub Registry <https://registry.hub.docker.com/>`_.

* each top-level directory maps to Docker Automated Build repository of the same name
* if there are any tags available (apart from ``latest``), those form next level of sub-directories
